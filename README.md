# Log over HTTP

## A logger for when you can't use `print`/`console.log`/etc. for debugging.

**Note:** The code was translated by ChatGPT and the elixir/lisp versions don't look right, the java/kotlin ones have an external dependency for some reason. I don't blame ChatGPT for the rust one if it turns out to be wrong, but I don't know rust and the rust compiler can stay out of my computer. I also really don't like the swift one. All of these will be fixed someday (except maybe the rust one).

### Usage

Copy paste the code for the appropriate programming language into your project, set the logger ID to something else (use random (but valid) chars to reduce the chances of others stumbling upon yours), and go to `https://hlog.deno.dev/<your_id>` to view/download logs.

The `server.ts` can be self hosted with deno.

Don't worry, "Let the logging begin!" was ChatGPT's idea, I don't write example text like that.
